# Assignment 4: Color Maker + Persistence

# Instructions
This application was developed in Android Studio and can be ran using an emulator for a "Pixel 3 API 21" device. 
In addition to the requirements, I also created the color display as a button so that I could implement a long-click 
function that allows the user to copy the RGB values to the clipboard.

To manually input a value for a color, the user must enter a value from 0 to 1 rounded to *3 decimal points*.
* Double-clicking the text-box will automatically clear the input. 

Pressing 'SAVE' will save the user's values and load it in the next time the app is entered.

Pressing 'RESET' will set all RGB values to '0.000'.
